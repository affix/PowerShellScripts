## PowerShell Tools

A small selection of Powershell tools and scripts that I've written for various tasks.

### Invoke-Socks

A simple SOCKS5 proxy server written in PowerShell for penetration testing, red teaming, or network pivoting scenarios. This is not designed to be performant or secure, but rather a quick and easy way to set up a SOCKS5 proxy for testing purposes.
